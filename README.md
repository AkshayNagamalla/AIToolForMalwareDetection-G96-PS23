# Slyfind - hidden malware detection
## AIToolForMalwareDetection-G96-PS23

Slyfind is a desktop application which offers three key functionalities: Obfuscated Malware Detection, Network Intrusion Detection, and PDF Evasive-Malware Detection.

Slyfind stands out for its speed in obfuscated malware detection, by focusing on specific digital artifacts within volatile memory. This targeted approach enables faster detection of obfuscated malware.
### Memory Forensics
Slyfind is designed to detect malware not only within our system but also across other systems, provided a memory dump is available. It aids in performing Root Cause Analysis, Forensic Investigations. This helps investigators understand the scope and nature of an incident and take appropriate actions to contain and remediate it.

### Obfuscated Malware Detection
Obfuscated malware refers to malicious software or code that has been intentionally obscured or obfuscated to evade detection by security tools and analysts. Obfuscation techniques are used to conceal the true intent and functionality of the malware, making it more difficult to analyze and detect.

Its significances are Enhanced Security Posture, Prevention of Data Loss, Protection Against Advanced Threats.


### Intrusion detection

Network intrusion refers to unauthorized access, malicious activity, or security breaches within a computer network. It involves attackers gaining unauthorized access to network resources, compromising system integrity, stealing sensitive data, or disrupting network operations.Detecting network intrusion is critical.It helps Network Security Monitoring, Real-time Alerts, Threat Detection.

### PDF Evasive-Malware Detection
PDF malware refers to malicious software or code that is embedded within PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Cybercriminals often use PDF files as a vector to distribute malware due to their widespread use in business environments and the inherent trust users place in document formats.
* So it becomes a necessity to perform malware detection.

## Description
SLyfind is an AI Tool For Malware Detection that uses advanced Machine Learning Algrithms to detect malware threats. 

### Memory Analysics
Detects Obfuscated Malware by extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.

STEPS:
>1.  RAM memory Capture (Magnet Forenciscs)
>2.  Extracting digital artifacts from Dump (Volatility3 Framework)
> 3. Classifying using ML
### Intrusion detection 
Monitors a network for malicious activity

>1. Network packet capture (Wireshark)
>2. Generate bidirectional flows (CICflowmeter)
>3. Classifying using ML
### PDF Malware Detection
Detects evaisve malware in PDF by static analysis

>1. Static Analysics (using pdfid , PyMuPDF)
>2. Classifying using ML
## Getting Started
